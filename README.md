# What do we expect you to create?

The assignment is creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) or Android/IOS Mobile application using Angular, Typescript and preferably using reactive programming using the powerful RxJS library.

You will be working in teams on the application so you are expected to plan together, divide the workload, use GIT flow so you can branch your work, merge or rebase when ready to a development branch and finally build a production ready PWA merged to the master branch.


# Must haves

The application should be responsive and show the content from the API in an attractive and intuitive way that works both on a small mobile screen or a large desktop browser screen. Currently the API supports Youtube for the music media. Show a player for it. 

The data of the API can be filtered on date using additional parameters and we expect you to create UI elements to be able to filter on date (year and week). 

We also want you to create a navigation menu and structure to switch between the 4 types of lists the API supports. 

Of course beautiful styling and animation is highly expected to create a fun, interactive and above all, attractive application. 

The design and layout is up to you but we want to see as much of the information the API provides back in your application and presented in an attractive way.  

As the data for a list is quite big to show in one long list UI for pagination is highly encouraged.


# Nice to haves 

Of course fetching data from the API each time you visit a section is possible but a sensible caching strategy is highly recommended to greatly improve the user experience for your audience.
